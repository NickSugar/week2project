This is my first project for Hari's new programming class.

I had a little trouble with making the buttons interactive with jQuiry. I feel like I followed the instuctions
on Codecademy exactly a few different ways and I can'nt seem to get it to work.

Also I tried to make the links on page 2 in to a <ul> but it just forces the links to the bottom right and the bullets to the top overlaping my header.

I hope to learn what my mistakes are and how to de-bug.
